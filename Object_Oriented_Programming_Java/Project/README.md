**Book & Member Management** – Allows adding books and members, storing details like title, author, ISBN, and member ID.

**Borrow & Return Functionality** – Members can borrow and return books easly.

**Exception Handling** – Custom exceptions handle errors like unavailable books, invalid member IDs, and already borrowed books.

**Library Statistics & Display** – Provides data about total books, members, and borrowed books, along with a list of borrowed books.
