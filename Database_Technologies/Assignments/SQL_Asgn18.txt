1) Create a table called Cityorders. This will contain the same onum, amt and snum
fields as the Orders table, and the same cnum and city fields as the Customers
table, so that each customerâ€™s order will be entered into this table along with his
or her city. Onum will be the primary key of Cityorders. All of the fields in
Cityorders will be constrained to match the Customers and Orders tables. Assume
the parent keys in these tables already have the proper constraints.


mysql> CREATE TABLE CITYORDERS (
    -> ONUM INT PRIMARY KEY,
    -> AMT FLOAT (10,2),
    -> CNUM INT NOT NULL,
    -> CITY VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    -> SNUM INT NOT NULL,
    -> FOREIGN KEY (CNUM) REFERENCES CUSTOMERS(CNUM),
    -> FOREIGN KEY (SNUM) REFERENCES SALESPEOPLE(SNUM)
    -> );
ERROR 6125 (HY000): Failed to add the foreign key constraint. Missing unique key for constraint 'cityorders_ibfk_1' in the referenced table 'customers'



GOT AN ERROE BECAUSE THE IN CUSTOMERS CNUM IS NOT CONSTRINT, BUT SINCE IN QUESTION THEY HAVE GIVEN US TO ASSUME ALL PARENTS ARE PROPERLY CONTRAINTS THE QUEARY ARE CORRECT.

2) Redefine the Orders table as follows:- add a new column called prev, which will
identify, for each order, the onum of the previous order for that current customer.
Implement this with a foreign key referring to the Orders table itself. The foreign
key should refer as well to the cnum of the customer, providing a definite
enforced link between the current order and the one referenced.



mysql> ALTER TABLE ORDERS
    -> ADD PREV INT NOT NULL;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> ALTER TABLE ORDERS
    -> ADD CONSTRAINT unique_cnum_onum UNIQUE (CNUM, ONUM);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0


mysql> ALTER TABLE ORDERS
    -> ADD CONSTRAINT fk_cnum_prev FOREIGN KEY (CNUM, ONUM)
    -> REFERENCES ORDERS(CNUM, ONUM);
ERROR 6125 (HY000): Failed to add the foreign key constraint. Missing unique key for constraint 'fk_cnum_prev' in the referenced table 'orders'
