## This is a Console Based Application to manage Contact Numbers.

### Mini-Project 1 based on DataStructurs of Java (Singly  LinkedList).

**Singly Linked List Implementation** – The contact list is managed using a singly linked list, where each node contains a contact’s name, phone number, and a reference to the next node.

**CRUD Operations** – The program supports adding contacts at the end, removing contacts by name, searching for a contact, and displaying all contacts.

**Efficient Traversal & Updates** – Contacts are searched and removed by traversing the linked list, ensuring dynamic memory allocation without fixed size constraints.

**Console-Based Interaction** – he main method demonstrates adding, searching, displaying, and removing contacts, providing a simple text-based interface.
