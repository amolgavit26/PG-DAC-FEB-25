# :books: Library Management System :ledger:
## This is a Console Based Application to manage the library.

### Mini-Project based on core-Java concepts

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Uses classes, objects, encapsulation and polymorphism to manage books, members, and the library.

**Collections Framework** – Uses List (ArrayList), Map (HashMap), and Set (HashSet) to efficiently store and manage books and members.

**Book & Member Management** – Allows adding books and members, storing details like title, author, ISBN, and member ID.

**Borrow & Return Functionality** – Members can borrow and return books easly.

**Exception Handling** – Custom exceptions handle errors like unavailable books, invalid member IDs, and already borrowed books.

**Library Statistics & Display** – Provides data about total books, members, and borrowed books, along with a list of borrowed books.
