            1. Create a Promise that resolves with the number 10 after
               3 seconds
            2. Create another Promise that resolves with the number
               20 after 5 seconds
        
            How can we log out the sum (30) of these two resolved values
            once, after BOTH promises successfully fulfill?
        
            HINT: Use Google/Documentation to help find an answer
            HINT2: You can Google for something like:
                   "resolve 2 promises at the same time javascript"
        */



        const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

                resolve(10);

                resolve(20);
            }, 5000);
        });

        Promise.all([promise1, promise2]).then((values) => {

            console.log(firstValue + secoundValue);
